 <h2>General</h2>
  
	
	
	<p>
	  All items purchased from Dream Furnishings are subject to the terms and conditions set out here and on the additional pages listed below. Please ensure you have fully read and understood the terms and conditions before ordering from the website. By placing an order with us you are accepting that you agree with the terms and conditions laid out and are bound by them. Should you require further clarification on our terms and conditions, please get in touch.
	
	</p>
	
	<h2>Product Information</h2>
	
	<p>    We have made every effort to accurately represent the information and colours of products on this website. However, as colours vary between different monitors, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display will accurately reflect the actual product colour. We will take every care to ensure that product information and pricing are accurate at the time they are entered. All sizes and measurements are approximate and we advise customers to consult the sizing charts when ordering as fittings may vary, especially between different brands.
</p>

<h2>Responsibility</h2>

<p>The responsibility for the goods transfers to the customer upon delivery, except in cases where the products received are damaged or the incorrect products have been delivered by us. Liability for items which are lost or damaged after delivery will belong solely to the customer.</p>


<h2>Ordering</h2>

<p>All visitors purchasing goods from Dream Furnishings are required to   register as a customer. This is a short process in which personal   information required (see our privacy policy) will be collected in order   to process the order quickly and accurately. When placing an order the   customer must ensure that their email address entered is correct and   their mail box is in full working order so they are able to receive   confirmation emails that are sent once their order has been accepted.</p>

<p>Contracts formed between you (the customer) and Dream Furnishings (the   retailer) will be governed according to English Law, and as such,   disputes which occur shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the English   courts.</p>

<p>Please ensure when purchasing items that you are aware of the total   purchase price. This amount will be confirmed to you on the review your   order page and on your confirmation email, and queries regarding pricing   should be raised as soon as possible. You are responsible for checking   prices at the time the order is placed as prices are subject to change   without notice.</p>

<p>Prices shown on the site are inclusive of VAT; however, you should be   aware that an additional delivery charge is applied. The total amount   payable, including delivery charge, will be displayed before the order   is confirmed by the customer and the order is placed. Details of our   delivery policy can be found in our help section.</p>

<p>All products are subject to availability. If an order is placed and   an item is not in stock then an email informing you of this will be sent   and that item will be cancelled and refunded.</p>

<p>If the item formed part of a multiple order then additional items on   the same order will still be dispatched, and the cost of the   out-of-stock item(s) will be refunded. If the out of stock item was   purchased as part of a multi-buy promotion (such as 2 for £30, 2 for £50   etc.) then we will refund your card at the promotional price (e.g. £15   or £25) so that you still receive the remaining item in the offer at the   promotional price.</p>

<p>The payment card will be debited immediately after the order is   accepted. Therefore if any item is subsequently cancelled a refund will   then be credited back to your account.</p>

<p>All credit and charge card holders are subject to validation checks   and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card   refuses to authorise payment to us, we will not be liable for any delay   or non-delivery. In addition, in the interests of preventing fraudulent   use of credit, debit and charge cards, Dream Furnishings will validate the   names, addresses and other information supplied during the order process   against commercially available records (Electoral Roll data, Credit   Reference Services). A third party may also be instructed to complete   these checks. By ordering from the Dream Furnishings website you consent to   such checks being made. We may need to contact you by letter, telephone   or email to verify details before we are able to process and dispatch   your order or we may be unable to accept your order. Any information   given may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may   keep a record of the information. All information provided will be   treated in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. These measures   are taken as extra protection for you, to ensure your online shopping   experience with us is as safe and secure as possible.</p>

<p>When an order is placed by the customer an email will be sent which   acknowledges receipt of the order placed. It is not an order   confirmation or order acceptance.</p>

<p>By placing an order via the Dream Furnishings website or over the   telephone the customer agrees to purchase the item(s) in question.   Acceptance of the order takes place once the order is dispatched and a   confirmation email is sent. The contract formed at this point relates to   the products listed in the dispatch confirmation email, and Dream Furnishings is not obliged to supply any further products (regardless of   order time) until a confirmation note has been sent to the customer.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse an order. Such refusal may arise from,   but is not limited to, the following situations: the item requested is   out of stock; we are unable to authorise payment for the order; and/or   an error in the item information, including pricing or promotion   details.</p>

<p>To cancel your order for any reason, please contact us via email or   telephone as soon as possible. If you have already received an email   from us stating that your order has been sent/dispatched, then please   follow the instructions on our Delivery/Returns page. </p>

<h2>Ownership</h2>

<p>Ownership of the products will pass to the customer on delivery of goods or upon receipt of full payment (including postage costs) being received by us, whichever is the later.</p>
